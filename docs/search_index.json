The RSE introduction to Git materials can be found at: https://ooominds.github.io/RSE_induction/ As a basic, the first thing you need to do is to configure Git so that it knows who you are: git config --global user.name &#39;Tania Allard&#39; git config --global user.email &#39;t.allard@sheffield.ac.uk&#39; git config --global --list 2.1 More about git config From RStudio, go to Tools &gt; Shell and tell Git your name and GitHub email by typing (use your own name and email): Note: If you are on Windows, check the title bar of the shell that was opened! If you see cmd.exe at the end of the status bar, this is the Windows Command Prompt. If you instead see MINGW64 at the beginning, you have successfully opened Git Bash! Note: If you are not in an R Project that is version controlled with git, Tools &gt; Shell will open Windows Command Prompt. If this is the case and RStudio still opens cmd.exe, check Tools &gt; Global Options &gt; Git/SVN and tick the box for “Use Git Bash as shell for Git projects”. You may need to restart RStudio. git config --global user.name 'Jennifer Bryan' This does NOT have to be your GitHub username, although it can be. Another good option is your actual first name and last name. Your commits will be labelled with this name, so this should be informative to potential collaborators. git config --global user.email 'jenny@stat.ubc.ca' This must be the email that you used to sign up for GitHub. These commands return nothing. You can check that Git understood what you typed by looking at the output of git config --global --list. "]
